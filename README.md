`username = "admin"` `password = "admin"`

Description:
A project generated with `create-react-app`, added SASS for handling styles.
Contains a change of theme between Dark and Light.
The index is based on a simple Login system (Without auth token) only conditional that you can improve if required.
Requests are handled with axios. :blush:
